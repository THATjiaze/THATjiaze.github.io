				summary:
					"<p>Alcohol has long been used in human history, and alcohol abuse has always been a huge risk factor to human health, leading to cardiovascular diseases, liver diseases, and myriads of mental problems. Thus, the elucidation of the sensing mechanism of ethanal, for example, its target molecule and the responsible neuronal circuit, is in urgent need for the development of drugs aiming to solve these problems. </p>			<p>Considering the well-structured nervous system, its ease for genetic manipulation, and that most of the proteins present in its nervous system has corresponding homologous proteins in mammals, C. elegans provides an ideal system for studying the sensing of ethanal. However, most current C. elegans research on alcohol focuses on ethanal exposure and in vivo metabolism, rather than on its sensing, besides, the receptor and the neuronal circuit behind ethanal sensing remains obscure. So, our lab tries to use genetic approaches and various other methods to illustrate the neuronal logic and key genes behind ethanol sensing. </p>			<p>After discovering that C. elegance displayed ethanal chemotaxis and that this behavior is dependent on the salt concentration of both the NGM plate in which the nematode is raised and that of the plate in which the behavior essay is performed, the focus of our research team turned to the characterization of this behavior in different transgenic strain that is deficient in various neuron, to find out the underlying neuronal circuit.</p>",

				summary:
					"<p>Working in a team of 5, my colleges and I first obtained worm strain deficient in certain neuron by the expression of caspase or miniSOG under neuron specific promoters. Then, by performing ethanal chemotaxis behavior essay, we found out key neurons required for ethanal sensing, and by analyzing the data, a preliminary conclusion is reached on how the activation of various neuron led to various behavioral output. </p>			<p>To make this conclusion more solid, two colleges and I used chemical genetics and optogenetics as an alternative method to inhibit or activate neuron activity, I am mainly responsible for the construction of worm strains that expresses light sensitive ion channels such as ChR or gtACR in specific neurons, to be used in further behavioral essay.</p>			<p>Furthermore, serving as another proof of concept, the same two colleges also used calcium imaging to directedly visualize the neuronal response when ethanal in sensed, of which process I also participated by the generation of needed transgenic worm strains. </p>			<p>As for the discovery of the underlying molecular basis. First, through a round of EMS mutagenic screen, a graduate student in the team found two closely linked genes whose malfunction led to abnormal chemotaxis behavior. To further characterize the function of these genes, I performed two consecutive rounds of CRISPR/Cas9 based gene knockout and obtained two strains that either has deletion in one of those genes or has double deletions in both genes, and I am currently working on the behavioral essay of these strains, to see if there are expected malfunction in ethanal sensing. </p>			<p>Second, we tried to see if known cellular signal transduction pathways participated in this process. Considering that calcium and calcium dependent kinases plays a central role in these pathways, we first decided to see whether worms lacking these kinases, thus lacking the ability to transduce signal through these calcium dependent pathways, will exhibit a normal chemotaxis output. In this process, I first characterized ethanal sensing behavior in strains lacking this kinase. Then, I generated worm strains that express this kinase under the control of neuron specific promoter, to see in which neuron that this calcium dependent signal transduction pathway took place. Last, considering that strain CB408, which lacks CAMK2, moves really slow on the essay plate, as a result, no information on its behavioral output can be obtained, we decided to use calcium imaging as an alternative way to characterize its response towards ethanal, and I am currently working on crossing this strain with other strains that expresses Gcamp in specific neurons, to be used for calcium imaging</p>.",

					"<p>Our research offered first insight of ethanol as a chemoattractive odorant to the nematode C. elegans and managed to find out the sensory neuron and the first level interneurons behind this behavior. Furthermore, we found out the influence NaCl has on ethanol sensing, thus offered an example of environmental factors influencing behavioral output and provided a model for the study of the integration of multiple sensory inputs.</p>			<p>This is the first project that I participated during my undergraduate research, and I surely learnt a lot from it. First, it acquainted me with basic experiment skills such as molecular cloning, microinjection, gene knockout, and so on. Second, it taught me how to think like a researcher: to extract conclusion from series of experiments and design another set of experiments to validate the conclusion. Most important of all, it taught me that although a lot of seemingly repetitive work is necessary (for example, repeating behavior essay on different strains or under different conditions), we should always understand why we are doing this experiment and how does it fit inside the big picture.</p>",
